# 4-DOF-Install-Guide
The 4 DOF Robot arm is a professional project, the installation does require some patience and familarity with using tools. This is also a DIY project, there are many different ways you can assemble this project, this guide is just the standard way, you don't have to follow this guide if you have your own ideas. However, if you do decide to follow the guide, please make sure that you read this install guide thoroughly and follow step by step. If you have any queries about the installation, feel free to contact us at http://www.uniultratech.com/contact.

## Step 1: Install the base
First look for the two base pieces and 2 sets of screws with the corresponding nuts. (although there are many holes to put screws in, two sets is enough in securing the base. You can choose to add more later).

Assemble the two screws with the base parts.

Next, find a server bracket and 4 sets of appropriate screws witht he corresponding nuts. This step is to secure the servo bracket in the base before the next part of the installation.

Assemble the servo bracket with the base like the following image. ***Notice*** the Direction of the servo bracket is very important.

Next, find a servo and 4 sets of screws with the corresponding nuts and washers(washers are needed because the holes for servos are bigger than the heads of the screws) You will also need 4 other individual screws to assemble the turning plate for the servo.(You can't find the correct 4 holes turning plate along with the servo bag. The turning plate of the server is provided in a separate bag along with some screws. They might be silver, but the graph we use has black turning plates)

Assemble the servo onto the bracket using the nuts and screws. The holes are on the side, make sure you double check the orientation of the servo.

## Step 2: Assemble the Arm
Take your prepared server mount and assemble it onto your server. Take another servo bracket, use the 4 screws we prepared previously to mount that bracket onto the base servo. Make sure the orientation of the bracket looks like the following. (***NOTICE:*** you might need to turn your servo around to make sure that it can successfuly turn to the range you want it to. Feel free to adjust degree of the servo and than assemble the bracket on top.)

Next, take a big head screw provided in the bag of the servo, and screw it through the center of the servo. Also take out one of the arm pieces with one set of screw along with nuts and a bearing.

Take the bearing and put it through the big hole of at either the side of the arm piece. Also put a screw through one of the center holes from your servo braket like the graph

Then assemble the arm piece to the servo bracket by putting the screw through the bearing like how the graph is showing. Take a nut and screw it onto the screw.

Now we are going to assemble the second servo onto the servo bracket. Take out a servo and 4 sets of screws with washers and nuts. A 4 holes servo turning plate and another 4 screws for the servo turning plate.

Then, you want to assemble the servo onto the servo braket. Notice the servo oreintation on the graph. Assemble the other side of the arm piece onto the servo turning plate, and screw the servo turning plate onto the servo. Now you need a big head servo turning plate screw like indicating in the graph. Screw that screw through the center of the servo turning plate into the turning hole of the servo.
